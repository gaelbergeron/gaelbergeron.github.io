  <h1>True values</h1>
  <h2>Your values are your lighthouse</h2>
  <h4>July 31st, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      Last week we discussed how stereotype threats can create frustration to individuals belonging to targeted social groups. This week we will take a step back and see how our values can help us be stronger in any social setting. I'm a strong believer in a more complete life achieved through genuine values. I personally have a few that act as my lighthouse in many situations: empathy, openness, commitment, growth and trust. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Being genuinely empathetic allows you to be a better listener and to make people comfortable when expressing their concerns or simply sharing their life. Empathy per se is rarely a topic of advice but it's something that, I believe, helped me give more relevant advice to friends, family and coworkers. Openness is also key, and allows you to develop deeper relationships. Being truely open is hard in a society that want us to fit in the box and censures vulnerability, but it's the difference between conversations that matter and superficial ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout my short career in the corporate world I've often been in situations where I would exhange pieces of advice with more junior or senior coworkers, which oftentimes also happened to be friends. The values I would prone are the same that I think will guide me in difficult times at Dev Bootcamp. Loving what you do is the first step to being good at it, but the journey takes commitment, when times are tough it is key to remind you of the commitments you made. You may realize they are no longer worth it and thatâ€™s ok, but you must check in on them regularly to see where you stand. Your drive for growth should help you stick to your commitments. I am a strong believer in growth to become a better individual, we should never stop learning, we should never stop analyzing our mistakes and act on our improvement opportunities.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last milestone advice is trust, more precisely trusting yourself. You must believe in your abilities and trust the people around you, or in the case of DBC, simply trust the program. Trusting yourself is also a way to be more patient with yourself, we often tend to expect perfection right off the bat, the one thing about achievers is that they never are perfect.
