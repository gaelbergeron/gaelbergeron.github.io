  <h1>4 tips to ask a terrific coding question</h1>
  <h2>I'm glad you asked!</h2>
  <h4>August 11th, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>Since I started Dev Bootcamp (i.e. 9 weeks ago), I researched coding problems dozens and dozens of times, I also posted 2 questions to my cohort. One was a silly question that my partner and myself wished we never asked, and a solid one that actually kept one of our guide from office hours busy for a while.</br>Researching and asking questions is an integral part of any developer’s day-to-day, no matter their level of experience, developers are always in learning mode. Being able to ask effective questions is therefore critical. Here is what I’ve learned throughout the last 9 weeks:</p>
    <h3>#1 – Write out loud to a busy colleague</h3>
    <p>Your questions should be as clear as possible, the explanation of your problem must feature any useful detail starting with the most important elements. Do not bother with greetings or any content not related to your coding problem. The copy should feel like a conversation between you and a busy colleague: start by explaining what you’re trying to accomplish, what you’ve tried so far and what you don’t understand.</br>One important thing: write the title last, make sure you understand every detail and recap the problem with a fact-based and to-the-point title.</p>
    <h3>#2 – Make sure your spelling is perfect</h3>
    <p>Your readers likely have a short attention span and after all you are asking for a favor, you can’t afford to post something with typos and grammar errors. Make sure to proof-read several times, ideally have someone read it for you.</p>
    <h3>#3 – Include your code</h3>
    <p>Almost all questions come up after writing some code, to be as specific as possible make sure to include it. Also include any error message that can help zero in on the problem. Do not feature your entire program, focus on the section that needs fixing instead. Posting everything would be a waste of time for your readers and you would reduce your chances of receiving feedback.</p>
    <h3>#4 – Respond immediately to feedback</h3>
    <p>Once you’ve posted your questions, make sure to come back to it regularly, every 5 to 10 minutes, and immediately respond to any feedback you get, be it a full-fledge answer or a request for more details. What matters here is to keep momentum and focus on your question. It will be in the headlines for a few hours at the most, make them count!</p>
    <p>I hope this short post will help you get better results for your next post. Good luck and happy coding!</p>
