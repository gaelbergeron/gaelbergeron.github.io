        <h1>Hi!</h1>
        <p>My name is Gael, developer in training at Dev Bootcamp. I’m currently residing in Montreal, Canada, but I’m originally from France. I moved to Canada in 2007 to attend college. In 2010 I graduated from HEC Montreal, the University of Montreal business school. I majored in finance but also took a few marketing classes as I had been hesitant as to which path to follow all along. Since university has ended entrepreneurship has developed into a strong interest of mine.</p>
        <p>I started my career at Deloitte Consulting as an analyst with the merger & acquisition team. I then moved on to work in corporate development for a small, but fast-growing real estate technology company. That’s when my coding illiteracy made itself apparent. After a few projects with the marketing team I started doing this full-time, working more and more with designers and developers. That is when my inabilities really started to bother me and my passion entrepreneurship developed into something more than a fleeting interest.</p>
        <p>My friends are also a big part of the story as to why entrepreneurship and technology has made its way to the forefront of my endeavours as of late. I’ve had the wonderful opportunity to closely follow the launch of several tech start-ups in the last couple of years and the challenge was real! A significant part of this challenge is knowing whether your product will actually interest potential consumers, but before that, a big hurdle is to figure out the actual technology. Learning how to make it work and how to convince developers to get on board when your product is just an idea involves a lot more than I had ever imagined.</p>
        <p>While at work or on side projects many conversations with developers would feel like I was talking to my doctor, he knows everything and I know nothing - trust him and it will be fine. That’s called asymmetry of information and it sucks. I would repeat to myself: "I mean, this little feature, how hard can it be!?" Well, that’s what I’m about to figure out here at Dev Bootcamp! It’s tough as hell sometimes, but it feels amazing.</p>
        <p>Outside of all this, I love hanging out with friends, entrepreneurs or not. I also enjoy photography, design, geopolitics and classic cars. A fun fact about me is that I only wear funny socks, I have tons of them, socks featuring ducks, pizza slices, Ninja Turtles, rabbits, burgers & cows, bacon & pigs (kind of mean), garden gnomes, pirates, Duff beer, Jesus, The Yeti and so on.</p>
        <p>Here are a few icons to learn more about me and get in touch. I’d love to hear from you. Thank you for reading!</p>
