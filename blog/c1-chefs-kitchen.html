  <h1>Dev Bootcamp: the community, the culture, the experience</h1>
  <h2>You are the chef, make it tasty</h2>

      Dev Bootcamp does a terrific job at managing expectations. Shereef Bishay, DBC co-founder, makes it very clear: do not expect to walk in a restaurant, pick from the menu and consume Dev Bootcamp; you are the chef. So, this experience is ours to own. I'm ecstasic and I'm freaking out.

        Most of my past education experiences, like for most people, has consisted of one-way lectures and half-baked group projects. But Dev Bootcamp is all about the community and intense weeks of learning something completely new. I'm freaking out because it's going to be tough,intense and full of failures. But I'm ecstatic because I know I will have a great time with great people. Only after one week of phase 0 one can feel the sense of community and helping one another. If I fail, someone will help, the same way I will do my best to be there for my peers.

        After one week of phase 0 I'm also starting to grasp the concept of "learning to learn". You start your day with a video that sounds like a foreign tongue (damn, Emmanuel, slow down!) and you wrap up your day with what it takes to fully understand it. See it as climbing a mountain, each day is a checkpoint, you get there, feel awesome and look forward to the next.

        I intend to make this experience my own, I'm excited. Let's see what happens!
        I would love any feedback, comment, question: gael.bergeron@gmail.com
